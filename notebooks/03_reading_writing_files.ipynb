For instance, the `'r'` mode will only allow to read the content of a file, and will not allow writing to it (this is useful to avoid accidental writing to the file).\n",

    "* `'a'`: open file in write-only mode, **appending** to an existing file with the same name\n",
    "  (otherwise the file is created).\n",
    "* `'rb'`, `'wb'`, `'ab'`: same as `'r'`, `'w'` and `'a'`, but reading/writing to/from binary files (such as `.zip` or `.bmp` image files). \n",
    "  The content is read/written as bytes objects without any decoding.\n",
